# Lumoslabs Challenge

Create a simple iOS application that, with the use of Google's API's, displays a map of the current area and shows nearby Italian restaurants. 
When choosing a restaurant on the map, display additional detail about the restaurant.

==============================
## First time configuration - after you clone the project you need to get the google maps SDK 
(from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start)

The Google Maps SDK for iOS is available as a CocoaPods pod. CocoaPods is an open source dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

* If you don't already have the CocoaPods tool, install it on macOS by running the following command from the terminal. For details, see the CocoaPods Getting Started guide.
sudo gem install cocoapods

* Open a terminal and go to the directory of the project where you can see a file named "PodFile":
cd <path-to-project>

* Run the pod install command. This will install the APIs specified in the Podfile, along with any dependencies they may have.
pod install

* Close Xcode, and then open (double-click) your project's .xcworkspace file to launch Xcode. From this time onwards, you must use the .xcworkspace file to open the project.
